 * Might also signal a room being created.
 * 
 * This packet contains the latest info about any room that's currently active.
 * May even be the room you're in. What a waste of bandwidth. And my time. 
 * While analyzing rooms, I was thinking "why isn't the server sending me anything about this room's changes?"
 * And I filtered this packet out, because it was received so frequently whether or not I was in a room.
 * I thought it was irrelavent. Turns out that no, you get every single update of every room. 
 * Because why not..?
